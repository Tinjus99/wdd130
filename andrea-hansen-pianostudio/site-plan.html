        Fees…
        The tuition for the 2023-2024 music teaching year will be from Sep 8, 2023 to May 11, 2023. 30-minute private lessons $75/month. This fee will be the same each month regardless of the number of lessons during the month.
        Summer lessons are available in June & July pay per 30-minute lesson.
        There will be a $15 registration fee due in August  to reserve your spot for the fall and to cover set up fees and copies for the year.  It is non-refundable. 
        There will be a $15 Jr Music Club registration fee due in August for participation in events throughout the year.
        Payment will be due at the first scheduled lesson of that month.
        A late fee of $10 will be added if payment is not received at the 1st lesson of the month.
        It is understood that if you start lessons in August that you will complete the year (thru May 2023).  If that cannot be done then you must give at least 1 month notice.
        There are 3 “sick” days built into the tuition this year.  There will be no make-up lessons scheduled or credits given for any lessons missed by the student or the teacher.  If the 3 sick days have been used up and I need to cancel a lesson for some reason I will credit that lesson back the following month.
        When you cannot attend your lesson you must contact me before your lesson time or it will be considered a “No-call No-show”.  The first No-call No-show you will be given a warning.  Any future No-call No-shows during the year may result in termination.
        There will be no refunds of monthly tuition for missed lessons by the student. 
        You may "swap" a lesson time with another student as long as you let me know in advance
        You are still expected to call ahead if you are not going to be to your lesson.   
        Lesson requirements…
        Bring all your books with you each time as well as your lesson binder
        1st time you don’t bring all your books = warning

        Be prompt!  Lessons are scheduled close together.  
        Books…
        New students will be billed for the method books that I choose for them.
        New music is needed from time to time for various reasons: student finished a method, festivals, additional practice, more repertoire, or other performances.  I will purchase new piano books and include them on your monthly invoice.
        Notice will be given before the music is purchased.

        The first month you do not maintain the 80% practice requirement you will be put on probation.  You will have 1 month to bring your practice percent back up to 80%.  If you cannot meet that requirement you will be terminated as a piano student. 
        If you are on probation more than 2 times during the piano teaching year you will be terminated as a piano student.

      <h3>Information for Parents</h3>
      <p>
I am very excited that you have chosen to take piano lessons with me. I have been teaching for 30 years. I love to teach!

As you begin piano lessons there are a few very important things that you need to provide for your student(s)...

1. Piano: It is recommended that you have an acoustic piano. It needs to be in good repair (no missing key tops or stuck keys) It needs to be tuned once a year. If you need a reference for a piano tuner please contact me. If you do not have an acoustic piano, but a digital keyboard please make sure that you have weighted keys. It needs to feel as close to a real piano as it can.

2. Lighting: Make sure that there is adequate light at the piano. I suggest a piano light as well as the overhead light. Shadows across the music make it much more difficult to read as well as causing eye strain.

3. Metronome: You will need to have or provide a metronome for your student to use at home in their practicing within the first few months of piano lessons. One of the most important things to look for in a metronome is how loud it is. When you are playing the piano sometimes you really have to strain to hear the metronome. The louder you can find the better. There are also free Metronome Apps you can get on your smartphones. Those will work as well.

4. Quiet practice place: It is important for your student to have a regular time that they will practice their piano. It can be in the morning, afternoon, or evening, but try to be consistent. The room where they are practicing need to be free from distractions of other siblings as much as possible. I know this is not always possible, but try your best. It will help their concentration immensely.

5. Encouragement: As a parent this is the biggest thing I feel you can provide for your student. Learning a musical instrument is a very rewarding, but difficult thing. There will be times when your student(s) becomes frustrated and they will need all the encouragement you can give them. There will be times that they need your help in understanding a writing assignment. Most of the time the instructions are in the book for what that assignment is. If after you have read the instructions and are still confused you are more than welcome to call me and/or email me for clarification. I have every confidence that you will be able to help your child through those tough times.

First Lesson:

Your student's first piano lesson with me will be a little different than future piano lessons. This first lesson is a time for us to become acquainted and hand out materials as well as cover any information that I feel I need to share with the student. I ask that the parent either stay for the entire first lesson or at least the first 10 minutes so I can share with you the things that I need you to know so you can help your student with practicing or answer any questions that I have about your child. Please plan accordingly.

When your student first begins piano lessons do not be surprised if it seems like they have very little to do as "homework" for at least the first week.

When you come to your first piano lesson....

• Be on time! The first lesson usually takes a little longer. We will need every spare minute we can get.

• Bring your first payment with you or pay online ahead of time.

• Make sure your student(s) has short fingernails. The student's fingernails need to be trimmed short. They should not tap on the keys with their fingers curved. If their nails are too long we do take their lesson time to have them clip them before their lesson starts.

• Wash your hands before you begin your piano lesson. You are more than  welcome to wash in my bathroom. Washing your hands keeps my piano keys clean as well as stopping the spread of germs from one person to the next.

• If you have previously taken piano lessons bring those books with you. It is helpful to have a book bag or backpack to keep your things together. If you are new and this will be your first lesson I will have picked up your books for you. You do not need to bring a tablet to write in. I provide a binder and all the other papers that you will need to record your practicing and other lesson papers.

What to expect at the first lesson....

• If you have already filled out your registration papers I should have most of the information that I need about your child. If there is anything else that I missed I will ask you then.

• If you are a beginning student and this is your very first lesson we will do several things. We will clap some rhythms, talk about right hand and left hand, and high and low. There might be some listening activities. These things are to help me know your student better so I can be the best teacher I can be for them.

• If you are a transfer student (you have had lessons in the past with another teacher) we will do some rhythm. I will have you sight read some music so I can assess where you are. I will ask you questions about what your last teacher did that you liked and didn't like. I will ask you questions about what kind of music you are interested in. I will push you to do harder and harder things and some of them you won't be able to do. This gives me the opportunity to see where you are, what we need to review, and if there are other gaps in the things that you have learned. Parents, please talk to your child about this before they come. They are not expected to be able to do everything I ask of them. I will end by asking you to play a piece of music that you like or one of the last ones that you have worked on.

• I will ask you some questions about their learning style and preferences as well as other activities that they are involved in and other things that they like to do. As I teach concepts I try to relate them to what they are interested in so that they "get it" easier.

• I will give you your lesson binder. We will review the different sections that are in there.

• I will give you your piano books. We will talk about how they are laid out.
• Then I will usually teach a simple concept and send the student home with instructions about how to practice and what to practice.

Multiple Children:

If you have multiple children taking lessons you are more than welcome to drop them off together and pick them both up at the end. They can work on their written theory, play some music games I have on hand, or they can play outside. During the winter they can play with Legos, blocks, or play dough quietly.

Attending your child's lesson:

You as the parent are welcome to attend your child's lesson. Sometimes this is very beneficial and sometimes it is a hindrance to your child. If you attend their lesson I ask that you sit quietly and listen as I teach the lesson. If you have questions about a certain thing that I'm teaching or you are uncertain about something that I have said if it can wait until the end of the lesson that would be better, but I understand that sometimes it is best to ask the question then. There might be times when I ask you to please attend a lesson. If we are having behavior problems so you can see what is happening. If this is at all possible I ask that you please try to attend. Sometimes the student will actually act worse with their parent attending their lesson. If this is the case I may ask you to just drop them off and then ask questions about things when you return to pick them up at the end.

Incentives:

I have lots of really fun incentives to encourage practicing. The student(s) will be earning tickets and can use those tickets to purchase things from my "store". There is candy, candy bars, gift cards, cash, and music that they can purchase. The student(s) can choose to spend their tickets. I also have a star chart and when the student has earned enough stars I give them sheet music to keep. It is so much fun for me to be able to give away music. It is fun to see the excitement in my students and they accomplish that and receive their reward of new music.

Contact Me:

If you or your child have a question please feel free to ask me. If you think there is a problem or a misunderstanding contact me right away. You are the one that is with your child all the time. You will be able to help me be a better teacher for your child if you will let me know of situations that may be affecting them. It could be something as simple as..."We are having a bad day today because...." or a fight with a friend, or illness, or death of a loved one (including a pet). All of these things have an effect on your child.
