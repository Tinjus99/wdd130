                    <ul>
                        <li>a. The tuition for the 2023-2024 music teaching year will be from Sep 8, 2023 to May 11, 2023. 30-minute private lessons $75/month. This fee will be the same each month regardless of the number of lessons during the month.</li>
                        <li>b. Summer lessons are available in June & July pay per 30-minute lesson.</li>
                        <li>c. There will be a $15 registration fee due in August  to reserve your spot for the fall and to cover set up fees and copies for the year.  It is non-refundable. </li>
                        <li>d. There will be a $15 Jr Music Club registration fee due in August for participation in events throughout the year.</li>
                        <li>e. Payment will be due at the first scheduled lesson of that month.</li>
                        <li>f. A late fee of $10 will be added if payment is not received at the 1st lesson of the month.</li>
                        <li>g. It is understood that if you start lessons in August that you will complete the year (thru May 2023).  If that cannot be done then you must give at least 1 month notice.</li>
                        <li>h. There are 3 “sick” days built into the tuition this year.  There will be no make-up lessons scheduled or credits given for any lessons missed by the student or the teacher.  If the 3 sick days have been used up and I need to cancel a lesson for some reason I will credit that lesson back the following month.</li>
                        <li>i. When you cannot attend your lesson you must contact me before your lesson time or it will be considered a “No-call No-show”.  The first No-call No-show you will be given a warning.  Any future No-call No-shows during the year may result in termination.</li>
                        <li>j. There will be no refunds of monthly tuition for missed lessons by the student. </li>
                        <li>k. You may "swap" a lesson time with another student as long as you let me know in advance</li>
                        <li>l. You are still expected to call ahead if you are not going to be to your lesson.   </li>
